Open Source Sinonasal Survey (OS3)
==================================

What is OS3?
------------
OS3 are a set of questionnaires that have been developed in the Department of Surgery- Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of Adelaide.
They are currently being given to all participants that get enrolled in studies related to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) research in our department.
We started using common questionnaires for CRS research in late 2011. The versions available in this repository are the result of gradual modifications since that initial version.

Why are the surveys provided under an open-access license?
----------------------------------------------------------
By open-sourcing our surveys, we hope to generate discussion about appropriate information-collecting instruments for CRS research. The end goal would be to improve global CRS multi-center research. The OS3 is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.

Is the OS3 peer-reviewed?
----------------------------
The OS3 has been developed in-house in our department. However it has not yet been reviewed by an external peer-reviewer (as of August 2014). It is one of our goals of publishing the OS3 to invite peer reviewed improvements to the surveys.

How is the OS3 administered?
----------------------------
The OS3 is administered in about 10 minutes. We tried to design it in a way so that it can be answered by participants on their own. However, we still advise if a doctor or researcher help administer it or at least revise it quickly with the participant at the end of the interview.

What about Quality of Life (QOL) measurement?
---------------------------------------------
| We use, and recommend, the SNOT-22 for its strong research profile.

| The SNOT-22 adds two extra questions (nasal blockage, and altered smell or taste) to the original SNOT-20, which is also a validated instrument.
